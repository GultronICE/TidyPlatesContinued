#### About this github

The primary reason for this github is to keep this addon working in the abscence of its authors. As such the likely hood of adding or improving features is relatively low.

*Please do open an [issue](https://github.com/Luxocracy/TidyPlates_BFA/issues) if you come across any bugs.*
